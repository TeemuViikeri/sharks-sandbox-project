**Project work owner:** Teemu Viikeri

**Evaluator:** Hanna Sep√§nmaa

**Tested with:** Xiaomi Redmi Note 8 Pro

**General notes**

- Android studio failed to sync gradle with my current version of android studio. It needed version 4.2 or newer so first I needed to update my android studio to get the app running.
- The second problem was my laptop's anti-virus program which tried to block the app but finally I got it working.

**User experience**

- First impression of the app was a bit confusing because I don't know anything about ice hockey teams and for example the abbreviations (player positions perhaps?) after player names don't mean anything to me.
- The ability to show players in different order according to name, player number or player position(?) seems very convenient.
- When the app starts the mediacontrols show up randomly in the bottom of phone screen even though there is no video visible on screen at that time. When scrolling down the video view appears at the bottom of page showing a video of previous match. It might be a good idea to make the mediacontrols visible while the video is not playing. First I thought the video was just a simple image because the controls were not visible.
- The statistics page of each player looked visually very nice and it was easy to understand.
- The overall user experience of the app was that it was easy to use and everything was positioned in a user-friendly way. All the colours matched perfectly giving the app a balanced look and the app looked great also when the phone's darkmode was on.

**The Code and Documentation**

- The complex json data was handled great with numerous data classes.
- The code was clean and descriptive and easy to follow even with all those data classes.
- The documentation of code was excellent.
- Documentation of the project in README.md had all the necessary information of the project, the features made in release 1 and 2, and the known bugs. Everything was explained very well and the section of features implemented in the future was an interesting addition.

**Grading**

- I would give a strong 4 to this app. It looks good and has great features that benefit a true ice hockey fan. If the mediacontrols would have worked perfectly the grade would have been 5.
